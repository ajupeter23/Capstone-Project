This capstone project successfully developed a reliable and accurate Python pip installation package, available via pip install, for predicting next-day hourly PM10 levels in the Penrose area using ML. The Random Forest and XGBoost models demonstrated exceptional performance in providing precise hourly PM10 level predictions for the following day.

Key Findings and Achievements:

• Data Preprocessing: I have condusted a indepth data preprocessing including outlier removal, missing value imputaion using KNN, although computationally intensive.

• Feature Engineering: Adding lag features and moving averages captured trends and seasonalities, significantly improved model accuracy.

• Model Performance: ML models like XGBoost, Random Forest, SVR, GRU, and LSTM led to 90% above accuracy for training and testing. However, only Random Forest and XGBoost provided accurate next-day hourly predictions for PM10 levels. Despite this, all models were included in the package for comparison purposes.

• Package Development: Developed a pip install package enabled easy deployment

Practical Implications:

• Accurate PM10 predictions can help Auckland Council to make informed decisions regarding air quality management, potentially improving public health. The developed package can be adapted for use in other regions or with other pollutants, broadening its applicability.

Innovative Aspects and Potential Impact:

• This project enhances environmental data analytics by using advanced ML and robust preprocessing methods. The innovative use of moving averages and lag features captures trends and seasonality, providing a framework for various time series forecasting problems. It aims to improve predictive analytics in environmental science, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for air quality monitoring.

Future Directions:

•Long-Term Predictions: Expand prediction possibilities by integrating more data sources and improving dataset continuity.

•Real-Time Data Integration: Incorporate real-time data from monitoring stations for timely insights.

•Advanced Imputation Techniques: Use more advanced imputation methods to better handle missing values.

•Model Optimization: Continue optimizing models for better performance with new algorithms and ensemble methods.

•Broader Applications: Apply the model to other pollutants or geographic areas to validate its robustness.

•Dashboard Development: Create a user-friendly dashboard with real-time data, visualizations, trend analyses, and alerts to make air quality information accessible and actionable.

In conclusion, this project demonstrated effective use of data preprocessing and ML for PM10 hourly predictions. The tools developed have practical implications for air quality management in Auckland and beyond. Future work should focus on extending predictions, integrating real-time data, and exploring broader applications to maximize the project's impact on environmental monitoring and public health.

Ethical Considerations

This is ethical since the publicly available air quality data have been used. Such data are available to anyone who has an interest and, therefore, allows transparency and inclusivity into the process. The project will also aim to follow Kaupapa Māori methodology in respect, relevance, and reciprocity in relation to research. There is a focus that the project outcomes will benefit the entire community, including Māori, through their worth in enabling better air quality management and public health protection. This approach guarantees that the research is culturally sensitive and respects the values and needs of all community members.
